    "This question is interesting because it applies directly to us as college students. By potentially identifying certain characteristics of diets that promote better living, we allow ourselves and others to make more informed choices about the food we eat. This dataset is also a source of interest, as the feature set is very rich and varied. Such a rich amount of features can let us discover potential correlations between student eating habits not only to GPA, but also to more interesting features such as happiness, nationality, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work and studies that have examined the relation between a student’s academic performance and diet have generally noted that those with healthier diets and generally more active lifestyle perform well academically in comparison to their peers. The factor with most impact from those related to diet is having a healthy breakfast, it has consistently shown to boost mood. Research suggests that diets high in trans and saturated fats can negatively impact learning and memory. These nutritional deficiencies impact cognitive development especially in concentration and energy levels. Previous studies on college students have concluded that college students in general do not care about eating a daily breakfast and that their diets commonly consist of cheap and quick meals. These are all factors which contribute to weight gain and emotional strain. This is something that we will want to explore and verify with our data.\n",

    "Since this is a very feature rich dataset, there are several columns that are redundant or inapplicable to our analyses, and we would have to remove these. Many of the columns contain natural language responses, which will need to be cleaned, tokenized, and processed with an NLP pipeline, for which we can use sklearn’s text extraction package. We will also have to deal with missing and incomplete data. For continuous values, we can infer missing data with polynomial regression, but for missing categorical data, we will likely have to discard that row for that particular analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to perform analyses on our data set, we much first gather a general idea of the shape and characteristics of the data. To this end, we plan to first visualize our data with scatter plots to ensure that issues such as outliers and excessive clustering can be addressed. For example, this may reveal that certain variables may have tiny variances, and so for those features, a logarithmic transformation would be appropriate. The bulk of our analysis will be to identify strong correlations between features. For this we can leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix, which measures linear correlation between two variables. We can confirm the correlations by calculating Spearman and Kendall correlations and confirming our discovered relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of our data is in the form of natural language, so sentiment analysis will be a necessary part of our pipeline. To extract workable data from natural text, we can use a count vectorizer, a TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse term frequency) vectorizer, or the classical word2vec model to create an actionable matrix from our text, on which we can run sentiment analysis algorithms. One option is using a pre-trained machine learning model to get around the issue of not having much training data. Once we have our natural language in vector space, we can feed these into our correlation analyses as well to see if positive or negative sentiments are influential to other features.\n",

    "Health is a big part of the overall picture when it comes to the quality of life of an individual. In the United States, many young adults leave their home and start an independent life upon college admission. During this period, college students are learning to make their own decisions. Hence this will help colleges and students make better food choices to increase overall quality of life. On the contrary, the analyses may also help us detect and rectify any incorrect assumptions people have about diet (eg. you should eat whatever you can in college to survive while spending minimal income). If our analyses ends up proving our hypothesis wrong, we will brainstorm ideas and see what went wrong and how we can find a better/larger dataset and confirm whether the analyses of the new dataset matches what we discovered in the original dataset.\n",

Since the dataset seems to represent students from a single town or university, it might not be completely representative of student habits in general. For example, the data might be aligned in a particular way because it could have been collected from a place that is very cold, food is cheap and average income is high. This might affect their habits and choices compared to students who live in places where the climate is warm and sunny, the food is expensive and average income is low.\n"
